ABSTRACT:

Clothing store System Project is a simple console application designed to demonstrate the practical use of C programming language with data structure and its features .This miniproject is an effective management system which is very useful for clothing shop owners to manage the stocks of the different clothing items available in the shop. In the olden days, clothing shops used to employ an inventory manager who used to manage all the stock details whenever the shop buys stock from the wholesaler or sell products to the customer. Inventory managers used to manually update the stock numbers by entering them in the register. But now with the help of this program, Clothing shop owners can manage the stocks of clothing items themselves by entering the details of the amount of clothing items bought from the wholesaler and the amount of items sold to the customer. When the user enters these details ,the program will automatically compute the stock details and display it to the user. This makes it very easy for the clothing shop owners to manage the stocks and they also donâ€™t need to employ a person for managing the stock. This clothing store system mini-also has an extra feature where the program displays the daily sales report in which it shows the various clothing items have been sold and the amount of money that has been sales in that particular day. This can be very useful for the clothing shop owners as it can give them a detailed overview of what clothing items are in higher demand 
so that they can strategically plan which clothing items to buy from the wholesaler and set a price for them so that they can generate a profit. This mini-project helps us understand various concepts of data structures in c programming language. This type of program can be 
extended for any type of product management system.
